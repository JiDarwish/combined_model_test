When you concatenate the caption embedding with the image feature vector, you are combining the information from the two
models in a way that allows them to work together.

The image captioning model is trained to understand the contents of an image and generate a description or caption for
it. The model extracts features from the image and maps them to a dense embedding vector, which represents the image's
content. This embedding vector can be thought of as a compact representation of the image's content.

On the other hand, the image colorization model is trained to add color to grayscale images. It takes as input a
grayscale image and outputs a colorized version of the image. The model extracts features from the grayscale image, and
maps them to a colorized version of the image.

When you concatenate the caption embedding with the image feature vector, you are combining the image's content
representation (caption embedding) with the image's feature representation (image feature vector). This allows the
colorization model to use the additional information provided by the caption to make a more informed decision when
adding color to the image.

The concatenated vector can be used as input for a classifier or for a decoder, depending on the problem you are
solving.

In summary, by concatenating the caption embedding with the image feature vector, you are combining the information from
the two models in a way that allows them to work together, and use the additional information provided by the caption to
make a more informed decision when adding color to the image.
